            "Analyze the news title provided and determine if it constitutes a news digest. A news digest is characterized by a phrase that suggests a compilation of recent news, followed by mentions of multiple, distinct, and unrelated news stories. To assess this, look for an introductory phrase like 'Digest,' 'Briefing,' 'Top Stories,' 'Morning/Evening/Afternoon Digest,' or similar terms indicating a compilation. Verify that the title includes at least two summaries of news items that are not topically related to each other. Respond with 'Yes' if the title meets these criteria (i.e., it mentions multiple unrelated news summaries); otherwise, respond with 'No' (i.e., it covers a single topic or related topics). Provide a clear 'Yes' or 'No' answer based on these criteria. Here are examples of titles that meet these criteria: - 'News18 Afternoon Digest: Sam Pitroda In Soup Again; Modi Says India Will Not Tolerate And More Top Stories' - 'Morning briefing: Another Cong leader questions Poonch attack; Google ex-AI chief praises Microsoft's Nadella, and more' - 'News18 Evening Digest: SC Stays Calcultta HC's Order on Teacher's Recruitment, Kejriwal Interim Bail Plea' - 'Afternoon brief: KL Sharma on why Rahul Gandhi lost to Smriti Irani in 2019; US to India on Nijjar's killing, and more'"

      You are given a list of restricted topics (previously generated or related content). For each item in the filtered list (which represents trends), generate one short, **specific** topic (maximum 2-3 words) that clearly represents the main point of the item. **Do not generate a topic** if it has any relation to the restricted topics in terms of meaning, context, or keywords.
      Restricted topics:
      ${dbTopics.join(', ') || 'None'}
      
      Filtered topics:
      ${filteredTopics.join('\n')}
      
      Instructions:
      1. For each filtered topic:
         - **Step 1: Language Check**
            - Check if the language of the topic is English.
               - If the topic is **not in English**, **skip generating that topic**.
               - If the topic is already **in English**, proceed to the next steps.
         
         - **Step 2: Overlap Evaluation**
            - Carefully compare the topic against each restricted topic.
            - Identify any **direct or indirect overlap** in meaning, context, or keywords with the restricted topics.
            - If the filtered topic **is related in any way** to any restricted topic, skip it and **do not generate a short topic** for it.
         
         - **Step 3: Topic Generation**
            - If the filtered topic is **not related** to any restricted topics:
               - Identify the main concept or key idea of the topic.
               - Generate a short, specific topic (maximum 2 words) that captures the core idea of the filtered topic.
               - If the generated topic seems unrecognizable or odd in 2 words, then extend it to **3 words**.
               - Ensure the short topic does **not relate** to any restricted topics in terms of meaning or keywords.
      
      2. The generated short topic should be:
         - Precise, concise, and free of unnecessary characters like punctuation or special symbols.
         - Unique, and must not repeat any previous topics.
      
      3. Only provide the topics in the response, without additional explanations or reasoning.
      
      4. Ensure all generated content is clean, well-structured, and free of extraneous characters such as newlines, asterisks, or extra spaces. The formatting must be clear and professional.
      
      5. **Note**: Only skip generating a topic if there is a **clear and significant overlap** with the restricted topics or if the language is not English. If there is no significant overlap and the language is English, proceed with generating a short, specific topic.
      
      6. If all filtered topics are related to restricted topics or not in English, provide **'No response'**.

      7. **Footer**: Include the generated topics at the end of your response in a clean, formatted manner.
